/*
Allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each
The memory is set to zero

Returns a (suitably aligned for any built-in type) pointer to the allocated 
memory
Returns NULL on error
If nmemb or size is 0, returns NULL or a unique pointer value passable to free()
If the nmemb * size = integer overflow, returns an error
NULL may also be returned by a successful call with nmemb or size equal to zero

Can fail with the error:
ENOMEM Out of memory. Possibly, the application hit the RLIMIT_AS or RLIMIT_DATA 
limit described in getrlimit(2)
By default, Linux follows an optimistic memory allocation strategy =>
When malloc() returns non-NULL there is no guarantee that the memory really is 
available
If the system is out of memory, one or more processes will be killed by the OOM 
killer

Normally, malloc() allocates memory from the heap, 
and adjusts the size of the heap as required, using sbrk(2)
When allocating blocks of memory larger than MMAP_THRESHOLD bytes, 
the glibc malloc() allocates the memory as a private anonymous mapping using 
mmap(2)
MMAP_THRESHOLD is 128 kB by default, but is adjustable using mallopt(3)

To avoid corruption in multithreaded applications, mutexes are used internally 
to protect the memory-management data structures employed by these functions.  
In a multithreaded application in which threads simultaneously allocate and 
free 
memory, there could be contention for these mutexes.  
To scalably handle memory allocation in multithreaded applications, glibc 
creates additional memory allocation arenas if mutex contention is detected.  
Each arena is a large region of memory that is internally allocated by the 
system
(using brk(2) or mmap(2)), and managed with its own mutexes.
SUSv2 requires calloc() to set errno to ENOMEM upon failure.
Glibc assumes that this is done (and the glibc versions of these routines do 
this)
Crashes are almost always related to heap corruption, such as overflowing an 
allocated chunk or freeing the same pointer twice
